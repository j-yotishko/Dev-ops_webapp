Project Title: CI/CD Pipeline for a Web Application on Azure
Project Description:
Create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys a web application to Azure, covering infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, containerization, CI/CD, and monitoring.

Objectives:
Automate the provisioning of infrastructure for a web app on Azure.
Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps.
Containerize the application with Docker.
Monitor the application using Azure monitoring tools.
Tools and Technologies:
Azure Services: Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure Container Registry (ACR), Azure SQL, Azure Monitor, Application Insights
Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Docker for containerization
Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipeline
Ansible or Azure CLI for configuration management
Azure Monitor and Application Insights for monitoring and logging
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Provision Infrastructure on Azure:
Objective: Use Terraform to set up the necessary infrastructure on Azure.
Steps:
Define Terraform files to create resources like Azure VMs for app hosting, Azure SQL for databases, and Azure Container Registry for storing Docker images.
Write configurations for Virtual Network and Network Security Groups to control access.
Run terraform init, terraform plan, and terraform apply to provision resources.
Deliverable: A set of Terraform files (e.g., main.tf, variables.tf) that can be used to spin up the infrastructure.
2. Containerize the Application with Docker:
Objective: Package the application in a Docker container.
Steps:
Write a Dockerfile for the app that includes all dependencies.
Test the container locally, then tag and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
Set up an ACR instance in Azure, and configure docker login to push the image.
Deliverable: A Dockerfile and the application’s Docker image stored in ACR.
3. Set Up Continuous Integration (CI) with Azure DevOps:
Objective: Automate the building and testing of the app whenever code changes are pushed.
Steps:
Create a project in Azure DevOps and push your code to the repository.
Define a YAML pipeline in Azure DevOps that builds the Docker image and runs tests.
Configure the pipeline to pull the code, build the image, push it to ACR, and trigger on code changes.
Deliverable: An azure-pipelines.yml file in your repository to manage the CI process.
4. Deploy with Continuous Deployment (CD) using Azure DevOps:
Objective: Automate the deployment of the Dockerized application to an Azure VM or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
Steps:
Define a release pipeline in Azure DevOps to deploy the Docker image to the target environment.
Use Ansible or Azure CLI scripts to deploy and configure the application on the Azure VM.
Configure your deployment pipeline to trigger automatically when the CI pipeline completes successfully.
Deliverable: A release pipeline in Azure DevOps, with scripts to manage deployment to your target environment.
5. Monitoring and Logging with Azure Monitor and Application Insights:
Objective: Set up monitoring and logging for real-time insights and alerts on your app’s performance.
Steps:
Enable Application Insights for detailed monitoring of your application’s performance, error tracking, and request metrics.
Use Azure Monitor to set up alerts, performance dashboards, and metrics tracking for CPU, memory, and network usage on your Azure VM or AKS.
Optionally, set up Log Analytics to store logs from different Azure services in a centralized location.
Deliverable: A configured Application Insights instance, Azure Monitor alerts, and a performance dashboard.
Expected Outcome:
This project will result in a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on Azure, with Docker-based containerization, real-time monitoring, and logging for your web application. You'll gain direct experience with Azure’s DevOps and cloud-native tools, as well as the ability to articulate this setup in interviews.
